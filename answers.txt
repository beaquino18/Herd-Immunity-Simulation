1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Population size: 500
    % vaccinated of people: 40% or 200 people
    Virus Name: Covid
    Mortality Rate: 20.0%
    Reproduction Rate: 80.0%
    # of People Initially Infected: 14

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
    - At Time Step 2, there were 33 people infected. That's 6.6% of the total population before the virus burned out.

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
    - Based on the simulation_log.txt, 55 people died out of 500. That's 11% of total population

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, 
    did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
    - Total of 245 people were saved from potentially becoming infected
